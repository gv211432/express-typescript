‚ÄúHome automation‚Äù refers to the automatic and electronic control of household features, activity, and appliances. In simple terms, it means you can easily control the utilities and features of your home via the Internet to make life more convenient and secure, and even spend less on household bills. Read on to find answers to some of the most common questions about home automation technology, and get a few ideas for home automation solutions to incorporate in your home.

Home automation is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that work to integrate everyday devices with one another via the Internet. Each device has sensors and is connected through WiFi, so you can manage them from your smartphone or tablet whether you‚Äôre at home, or miles away. This allows you to turn on the lights, lock the front door, or even turn down the heat, no matter where you are.
